        <p>This week I learned about Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). CSS is used to style HTML markup such as modifying font sizes and types or by changing the overall page style with margins or padding. CSS uses <strong>selectors</strong> to style elements. There are different types of selectors:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Type selectors - which select based on an element's type (e.g. paragraph, header 1)</li>
          <li>Class selectors - which select based on an element's assigned class(es) (e.g. menu)</li>
          <li>ID selectors - which select based on an element's assigned ID (e.g. week3)</li>
          <li>Attribute selectors - which select based on attributes of tags (e.g. the href of a link)</li>
          <li>Pseudo-classes and Pseudo-elements - which select based on certain element states (e.g. a:hover, when a link is hovered over)</li>
          <li>Combinators - which are used to combine multiple selectors together (e.g. article > p selects all paragraphs that are direct children of articles)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I also learned that not all browsers treat CSS in the same way, and that a stylesheet called "normalize.css" exists that can be used to have all browsers treat your CSS identically.</p>

          <h3 id="week4">Week 4: Styling fonts</h3>
          <p class="published">Published on <time datetime="2023-11-02">November 2, 2023</time></p>
        </header>
        <p>This week I've learned about styling fonts, fallback fonts and importing external fonts.
I learned that there are two different ways to import external fonts, either using a &lt;link&gt; tag or by using @import in a css file. I was curious about the difference between the two: if there was any real difference and why the example chosen was to use &lt;link&gt; instead of @import.
I found that the reasoning was performance<sup>1</sup>: it's not recommended to use @import, as it has a performance overhead on the loading of the site. @import doesn't always download stylesheets in parallel - they are downloaded sequentially, one after the other if any &lt;link&gt; tags are used to load fonts or if @import is used across multiple stylesheets. This means that the site will take longer to load if you mix @import and &lt;link&gt; or have multiple stylesheets using @import. To contrast, if &lt;link&gt; is used, each font will be loaded in parallel, regardless of where it is used, so the loading time of the website will only be affected by the longest-loading font.</p>

            <h3 id="week5">Week 5: Responsive Web Design 1</h3>
            <p class="published">Published on <time datetime="2023-11-02">November 30, 2023</time></p>
          </header>
          <p>In this week's tutorial, I learned how to create a responsive website, using media queries and css grid layout structure. As well as this, I spent some time modifying the site to my own liking, and I set up a git repository on the brighton domains server so that I can work with the files in a way that is familiar to me. This also means that I have a much more natural way of keeping track of what I've done each week, which is a very happy bonus.
The commits I made this week were as follows:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Indentation, fix stylesheet.css</li>
            <li>Change h1 style, improved page layout, changed media query

I didn't like the way the header was styled - it was still using placeholder css, so I've had it use the same font as the rest of the page - I feel that Sans-Serif suits the style of the page much better, and given it a very dark teal for the colour. Also changed the link colours so they behave how a user expects, but they use slightly calmer colours than default. I made the main section take up all three columns in the largest layout, I prefer this. I am considering adding another media query to widen it again past another threshold, since the page still feels a bit too narrow past a certain point</li>
            <li>Improved padding and footer wording</li>
          </ul>
