        <h2>I have a problem;</h2>
        <p>I procrastinate on essentially everything, pretty much all of my obligations. As you can imagine, that's not exactly conducive to living independently or studying at university. So here I'll be going through how I'm starting to sort that out for myself, for (hopefully) better grades and a less stress-filled life.</p>

        <p>Lucky for me, in the final week of Christmas term, we had a guest lecture, the topic for which was tackling procrastination. That lecture had some useful tips, and pointed me towards a time management technique that I now use called the Pomodoro Technique. This has been quite helpful, especially in conjunction with the other things that I have learned since.</p>

        <p>As per the instructions of this course, I've gone and completed a LinkedIn Learning course about curbing procrastination (Bailey-Hughes, 2018). The key things that I've learned from it are why I procrastinate, how I can work past that 'why', and what makes me work best. The things I've learned from this course are being applied right now as I work on this page, and it's making me more productive.</p>

        <p>I've learned that I procrastinate because I'm both distracted really easily, and I get overwhelmed by a monolith task. Additionally I have some unwarranted confidence that leads me to believe I'll be able to do tasks in days, when they are allotted months. These first two are pretty easy problems to solve, it turns out, and hopefully the third becomes irrelevant as I complete things in a timely manner and they turn out better.</p>

        <p>To fix these, I've really only had to do a few things. Namely, I write down the things I have to do on paper. I typically keep track of my To-do's digitally, but I can't always have that in front of me, so my priorities can slip. Instead, I write them down in my notebook and I have that in front of my laptop as I work. That way I can defer to the notebook instead of the untrustworthy self when I finish a task or lose my thread. There's a particular way that tasks are written down in the notebook, though. First I write down everything that I know I need to complete, on a macro level. This is the monolith tasks that I mentioned earlier.</p>
         <!--Monolith tasks picture-->
        <p>Next these tasks need breaking down. This is common in CS so I'm fairly used to doing this, having worked on projects in the past: it's decomposition. So I decompose the monoliths into... "polyliths". Lots of small tasks - the smaller, the better. The aim is to break everything down to be atomic. Although, it's worth noting that there's no point in spending 3 hours creating a To-do list instead of doing your work. I've been victim to that in the past. Once all the tasks are created, I can order them by priority - typically deadline. This way I can tackle the most important things first - by mandate of the notebook. Even if I don't get everything done, at least the most important things are the most done.</p>

          <p>Discussing these things with my partner, as I'd realised that he might benefit from some of the other advice in the course, I also realised the way I work best: </p>
          <blockquote>
            I need a cup of tea.
          </blockquote>
          <p>The tea serves several purposes besides hydration and being delicious. When I take a sip, it gives me a little micro-break, in which I can process what I just did and the next steps, or have a little think about what I was reading. The difficulty, of course, is that eventually I drink the whole cup and have to get up to make another. This tends to give me an excuse to procrastinate and I'll lose my flow. So now what I do is, before I sit down to work, I'll make a pot of tea. That'll last me five cups, which is about 3-5 hours of work. It also gives me an organic timer<sup><a href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup> - I don't want to stop working if I've still got tea to drink (that's work tea!), and I don't want to be slow and let my tea go cold.</p>
        <!--Improvements, failures etc.-->
        <p>Prior to all this learning, this page probably would have taken me several days - one of which would have been dedicated to the 20 minute video course. I've done everything in one day, and I'll be able to finish another assignment tomorrow. That doesn't, unfortunately, fix past-me's mistakes. I'm behind on lectures that I missed because of illness that I really could have (and should have) caught up on by now. This methodology also isn't iron-clad. I can still get distracted if somebody distracts me - I can't turn my phone off for personal reasons, so I can still be reached via mobile while I'm working. I can filter out who can reach me, thankfully, so I don't get distracted by every notification. It's still possible I'll be interrupted occasionally though. Thankfully I actually enjoy getting things done, so I'm generally pretty eager to get back to doing work as soon as possible.</p>
