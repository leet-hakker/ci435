# Links
## index.html
Found no links that did not work as intended. Link to "Learning Journal" targets "#", correctly.
## contact.html
Found no links that did not work as intended. Link to "Contact Me" targets "#", correctly.
## tutorial.html
Link to "Tutorial" mistakenly targets "tutorial.html", forcing reload. It should target "#". This has been fixed.
# Images
On brighton.domains, I have no difficulty loading any of the images, they all load promptly and exist on the server.
# Criteria
I think that the site overall meets the marking critera, and I'm fairly pleased with how it's turned out.
